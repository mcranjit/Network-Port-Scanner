# Network & Port Scanner

A Python-based tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) for scanning devices on a network, identifying open ports, and inferring device types. This project is useful for networking enthusiasts, administrators, and beginners exploring cybersecurity.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Discover devices connected to a given network range.
- **Port Scanning**: Identify open ports for each detected device.
- **Device Identification**: Infer device types based on open ports and fetch manufacturer details using MAC addresses.
- **Status Check**: Check if devices are online or offline.
- **Result Export**: Save scan results to a CSV file for documentation or further analysis.
